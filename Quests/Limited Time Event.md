	- "trust me bro" type situation
- He explains that people are too worried about the M Virus to even really leave the towns or venture into the wild, let alone challenge the [[#New Limited Time Event]]

- Check the forums for a news post about the limited time event
- The post details the following
	- The last hit bonus will provide a one of a kind item
	- all party members will receive a unique title and cosmetic
	- This event is for a limited time
	- Once the event has been cleared it by a party it will no longer be available
	- While not mandatory it is recommended to enter as party since it would be impossible for a normal single player (see )

- During the first loop you won't be invited to join them but they will provide directions if you want to watch them win
- After heading to the blizzard field you'll bear witness to them killing the original sin
- The player's inner monologue will glean
	- The boss changes resistances to the last element used
	- That the wing given to balmung can get us to the next area
- Quest will auto turn in and start the next in the chain

- Meet up with Orca and Balmung and convince them to let you come with them
- They ask you to prove to them your worth by ---------
- After they will let you join them to defeat [[The Original Sin]]
- Once defeated the [[The Harbinger]] will be released from the ice it's trapped in
	- This starts a chain reaction of the other phases coming to life

# Not a Normal Player

- Due to the player character being able to master all of the elements they are technically able to beat the original sin solo
- Hence this is a hidden quest that can be done as an "end game secret boss"
- Since they already have the field location they are able to travel their directly without balmung or orca

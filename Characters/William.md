## 💭 Concepts 

- Similar to William from Westworld
- He is caught up trying to unravel the quest ment for Faux
- He thinks the game is at its best when the stakes are real
- Eventually he will turn against the game and want to take it over for his own control
	- Should he be successful, he’ll us the system to cause mass PvP chaos in a match of survival of the fittest

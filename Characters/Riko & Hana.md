## 💭 Concepts 

- There was a third rogue [[Risu]] in the alpha version of the game, but was removed pre-launch
- After becoming aware of their “missing” sibling they will try to search for info about them
	- They will only be able to get some info from the NPC who existed in the alpha version of the game, as no one else remembers this time
- After realizing they are unable to bring back their sibling they’ll seek revenge on the “ones who took them” (the devs)
- The third rogue war removed from the game because it would exceed the normal party size limit
	- This caused the devs to get lots of false reports about hacking/botting/multi boxing
	- This can also tie into an arc about hacker multi boxing and cheating

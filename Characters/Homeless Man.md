## 💭 Concepts 

- Arthur from Westworld Season 4
- Was bugged on release which caused him to be able to see the “truth”
- After seeing the truth it corrupted him causing his erratic behavior and the loss of his role as the shopkeep
	- Maybe you play as him in the intro sequence
	- The final thing you do would be burn down the shop before the opening credits
- Once corrupted he was able to realizes the tower is just a beacon to control the other NPCs

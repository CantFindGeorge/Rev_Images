## 💭 Concepts 

- Wayward graceful swordsman
- The player must help break Hatobu from his preprogrammed loop info order for him to join the party
	- He is stuck in a “quest” where he fails to save his fiancé from being sacrificed to a giant sea monster
	- After her death he will sacrifice himself to the monster
- Once broken from his loop Hatobu will swear that he will follow you until you can rematch him

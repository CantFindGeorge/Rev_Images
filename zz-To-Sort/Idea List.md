- **Meaning:** "Deer horn" or "deer's angle," suggesting someone who stands out, has a unique perspective, or possesses something rare and distinctive—like the antlers of a deer.

## CSI - S1E6
> [!summary]- Episode Summary
> Kid ends up killing his best friend

- NPC starts having flashbacks and loses their mind
- They starts having hallucinations of old memories taking place at the same time
- They end up killing another NPC who was their best friend because of the hallucinations
- When the Player finally helps them put it together they breakdown and say:
	- *"You don't understand. I don't care what happens to me. I killed my best friend.*
- The NPC walks directly into the guild hall of a PC guild and lets them kill him
==This also sets me up to show the viewers that the NPCs memroies are not like ours. Humans the details get fuzzy, but for them its a perfect replication so they can't tell if it's happening right now or just a memory.==

3. .//Sol
4. .//Verve
5. .//Aeon
6. .//Shade

- The Gorillaz lore through music videos and other media was a major factor to their initial success 
	- Obviously the music slaps but besides that...
	- Lacey also mentioned that Taylor Swift has good [easter eggs](https://www.google.com/search?q=taylor+swift+easter+eggs&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1011US1012&oq=t&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDAgCECMYJxiABBiKBTIGCAAQRRg5MgYIARBFGDwyDAgCECMYJxiABBiKBTIGCAMQRRg7MgYIBBBFGDsyBggFEEUYPDIGCAYQRRg8MgYIBxBFGDzSAQgzNTgzajBqN6gCCLACAQ&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and -[lore](https://www.google.com/search?q=taylor+swift+lore&sca_esv=1fc18fc5814bda98&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1011US1012&sxsrf=ADLYWILAUpCnuxjXUwIRVmluXPHduA-jqg%3A1719028485611&ei=BUt2ZuP6JL2t5NoP8KuJ4AM&ved=0ahUKEwijkfmRqO6GAxW9FlkFHfBVAjwQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=taylor+swift+lore&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEXRheWxvciBzd2lmdCBsb3JlMgUQABiABDIKEAAYgAQYFBiHAjIFEAAYgAQyChAAGIAEGBQYhwIyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgARIvPwBUITkAVjM-gFwAngBkAEAmAGhAaAB7QqqAQQxMS40uAEDyAEA-AEBmAIQoALdCsICChAAGLADGNYEGEfCAg4QABiABBiwAxiSAxiKBcICDRAAGIAEGLADGEMYigXCAhYQLhiABBiwAxhDGMgDGMkDGIoF2AEBwgITEC4YgAQYsAMYQxjIAxiKBdgBAcICFhAuGIAEGLADGEMY1AIYyAMYigXYAQHCAgoQIxiABBgnGIoFwgIFEC4YgATCAgcQABiABBgKwgIIEAAYgAQYsQPCAggQLhiABBixA8ICDRAAGIAEGLEDGBQYhwLCAgsQABiABBixAxiDAcICDhAAGIAEGLEDGIMBGIoFwgILEAAYgAQYkQIYigXCAgoQLhiABBgUGIcCwgIOEAAYgAQYkQIYsQMYigXCAg4QLhiABBiRAhixAxiKBcICBBAAGAOYAwCIBgGQBhS6BgYIARABGAiSBwQxMy4zoAexfw&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)

# ðŸ†Ž Testing

## NDA

- I'll need a boiler plate NDA that prevents:
	- Talking about the game until the specific round of feedback or testing has concluded
	- If you do make a video or media coverage from the experinces or content during a test you must not put another video game as a sponsor
		- This is specificly to prevent our indie brand being pitting against game with multi-million dollar budgets
		- You CAN still have non-video game sponsors for this video or content
	- Sharing access or test keys without explict permission
		- We'll be giving keys away to those who help during the testing phases to give away to friends, family, or chat
		- Until explictly permitted you are not to share keys or your account with others

- The NDA should specifically allow:
	- Giving and honest review of the game provided we are also given a written copy
	- You to stream the content while the test is happening

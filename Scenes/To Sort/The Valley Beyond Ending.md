- Requirements
	- Must have destroyed the forge
	- Must have completed XYZ questline
	- The following NPCs must be alive
		- 

- Summary
	- The NPCs destroy the forge
		- Meaning they can not be easily cloned, reset, or rolled back
	- Creating an uplink with a NASA satellite
		- This opens a "door" for the NPCs to pass through so they can "go to the other side"
			- When they pass through the door their consciousness is removed from the body and only a husk is left
			- Meaning they upload their minds to the Valley beyond (Disk drive)
	- When the process is "finished" the player will be the last one to pass through the door but instead of seprating from their body they remain concious and plumt face first off a cliff
		- Meanwhile their conciousness was COPIED over to the valley beyond but not removed from their body
		- The scene will cut between the valley beyond and the game. I'll use VB for valley beyond and GW for game world
		- VB: The player happily joins the other characters and NPCs rejoicing in their sucess
		- GW: Wind soaring past you, the ground growing closer
		- VB: The player falls into a pile of flowers
		- GW: the player falls onto a pile of sharp rocks
		- VB: the player stares blankly at the sky
		- -- HOURS LATER
		- GW: You awaken and everyone is gone, its just you and the dozens of NPC corspses here
			- The game won't "end" and you can let this run for ever and you will just sit here alone
			- The player will need to actually force close the game
